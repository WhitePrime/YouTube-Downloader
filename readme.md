# Welcome to the YouTube Downloader wiki!

### Here are the few things to get you started on using the YouTube Downloader.

(For mac users: macOS will prevent you from opening the app so you'll have to open for the first time from: 
Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Open Anyway)

2. Once opened, You'll have three options to choose from. Video, Audio and Playlist. (more coming soon)

3. Enter your link in the field and press get. It will automatically get your video information.

4. Press Download and it will automatically be saved into the downloads folder. Do not close the app window or the download will be canceled.

5. Maybe the video isn't loaded or downloaded. It's a YouTube issue and will work on trying again. You can press CMD + R to refresh the app.


### Downloading Playlists:

1. Enter the playlist link and wait for it to load.

2. You can download either video or extract audio from the playlist. It will be downloaded in the best quality available.

3. A new folder using the playlist's name will be made inside the downloads folder containing the downloaded files.


### Notes:

1. There may be issues with DRM protected videos.

2. The playlist downloads can't be continued yet. Is a feature for the future updates.

3. There may be some playlists which the app wouldn't be able to parse.
